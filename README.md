# Airbnb Clone Project (StayBackend)

## Project Overview
This project is a backend implementation of an **Airbnb Clone**, designed to simulate a real-world booking platform.  
It focuses on **backend systems, database design, API development, and application security**, with the goal of building a scalable and secure web application.

## Project Goals
- Understand and implement modern backend architecture.  
- Design and document relational database structures.  
- Develop RESTful and GraphQL APIs for user interaction.  
- Apply robust **security measures** to protect sensitive data.  
- Automate deployment pipelines using CI/CD practices.  

## Technology Stack
- **Django** – Web framework for backend development and APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** – Relational database system.  
- **GraphQL** – API query language for efficient client-server communication.  
- **Docker** – Containerization for easy deployment.  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation.
